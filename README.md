# autoUpdateTest

This is just the test area where I debug [GitAutoUpdate](https://github.com/mredig/GitAutoUpdate). It also acts as a good working example of the autoupdater. Feel free to fork and play around by editing the pre and postflight scripts to do something in `/tmp` so you can see for yourself how this works.
